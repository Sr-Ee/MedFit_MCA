## About
- Diabetes can be controlled if it is predicted earlier. Hence, this project aims to perform early prediction of Diabetes in a patient by applying various Machine Learning Techniques.
- These techniques provide better results for prediction by constructing models from datasets containing various information about different people.
- Algorithms used were: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Na√Øve Bayes(NB), and Random Forest (RF). 
- The accuracy for each model was calculated.
- Results showed that SVM achieved higher accuracy compared to other machine learning techniques hence, it is used for prediction in the web application.
