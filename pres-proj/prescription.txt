Antiemetic medications may be recommended to control vomiting and nausea. However, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before starting any new medications.  Dietary Considerations: Stick to light and easily digestible foods such as crackers, toast, or broth-based soups. Avoid spicy, fatty, or greasy foods that may further irritate the stomach.

Ensure the compress is wrapped in a cloth to avoid direct contact with the skin.						     Contact Number: 8108431208
