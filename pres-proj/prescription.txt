Advice: 
Rest and Hydration: It is important to get plenty of rest and stay hydrated. Make sure to drink an adequate amount of fluids, such as water, clear broths, or electrolyte-rich beverages, to prevent dehydration.

Medication Management: Take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, as directed to alleviate headache and fever. Antiemetic medications may be recommended to control vomiting and nausea. However, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional before starting any new medications.

Dietary Considerations: Stick to light and easily digestible foods such as crackers, toast, or broth-based soups. Avoid spicy, fatty, or greasy foods that may further irritate the stomach. If solid foods are difficult to tolerate, opt for small, frequent meals or snacks.

Cool Compress: Applying a cool compress or ice pack to the forehead or back of the neck may help relieve headache symptoms. Ensure the compress is wrapped in a cloth to avoid direct contact with the skin.						     Contact Number: 9322594634
